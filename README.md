## About this project

The idea of the App is to test my skills building an interactable calculator with a pretty UI.

## Why?

This project is part of my personal portfolio, and as expected from a calculator, even a simple one, there are lots of challenging details from a logic point of view. I'll be more than happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, code structure and so on!
